## High-Level Architecture

my-kit is a collection of Claude Code commands, skills, and audit agents, distributed via GNU Stow symlinks.

### Components

- **Commands** (`~/.claude/commands/mykit.*.md`) — Slash commands that users invoke directly
- **Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) — CLAUDE.md instructions that teach Claude domain knowledge
- **Audit Agents** — Specialized prompts that review code for quality, security, and compliance

### How It Works

1. **Stow** creates symlinks from `~/.my-kit/` into `~/.claude/`
2. Claude Code discovers commands and skills via its standard paths
3. Commands orchestrate workflows; skills provide context; agents audit results

See [Stow Layout](/architecture/stow-layout/) for the full directory structure.
