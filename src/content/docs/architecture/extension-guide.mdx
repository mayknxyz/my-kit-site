## Creating Custom Skills

my-kit's skill system is extensible. You can add domain skills for any framework or tool.

### Skill File Structure

A domain skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude about a technology:

```markdown
# [Technology] Skill

## Conventions
- File naming patterns
- Project structure expectations
- Code style preferences

## Patterns
- Common implementation patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Integration
- How this technology integrates with the rest of the stack
```

### Adding a Skill

1. Create a markdown file in `~/.my-kit/.claude/skills/domain/`
2. Re-stow: `cd ~/.my-kit && stow -t ~ .`
3. Run `/mykit.sync` in your project

## Creating Custom Commands

Commands are markdown files that define slash command behavior.

### Command File Structure

```markdown
# /mykit.your-command

[Instructions for Claude on what this command should do]
```

### Adding a Command

1. Create a markdown file in `~/.my-kit/.claude/commands/`
2. Name it `mykit.your-command.md`
3. Re-stow: `cd ~/.my-kit && stow -t ~ .`
