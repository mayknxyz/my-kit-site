## Your First Workflow

my-kit follows a spec-driven pipeline: **Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Ship → Audit**.

1. **`/mykit.specify`** — Describe what you want to build. my-kit creates a structured spec.
2. **`/mykit.plan`** — Claude generates an implementation plan from the spec.
3. **`/mykit.tasks`** — The plan is broken into trackable tasks.
4. **`/mykit.implement`** — Claude works through each task, writing code.
5. **`/mykit.commit`** — Stage and commit with conventional commit messages.
6. **`/mykit.pr`** — Create a pull request with auto-generated summary.
