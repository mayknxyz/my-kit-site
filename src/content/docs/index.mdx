## What is my-kit?

my-kit is a public, MIT-licensed toolkit (v2.8.2) that extends Claude Code with structured workflows, domain expertise, and quality gates. It turns Claude into a spec-driven development partner.

  <Card title="29 Commands" icon="terminal">
    From `init` to `release` — a complete CLI covering setup, development, shipping, auditing, and issue management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="29 Skills" icon="puzzle">
    Domain skills for Astro, Svelte, Cloudflare, TypeScript, Tailwind, testing, and more. Claude learns your stack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="5 Audit Agents" icon="approve-check">
    Automated quality gates that review security, accessibility, performance, code quality, and spec compliance before you ship.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spec-Driven Workflow" icon="document">
    Every feature starts with a spec. Plan, task, implement, ship — a structured pipeline that keeps work on track.
