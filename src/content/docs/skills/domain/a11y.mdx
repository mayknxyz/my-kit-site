The accessibility skill gives Claude deep knowledge of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance — ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader support.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when working on accessibility-related tasks (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, contrast checks).

## What It Teaches Claude

- First Rule of ARIA — use native HTML first, ARIA second
- Keyboard navigation patterns (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys, focus traps, skip links)
- Color and contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for UI components)
- Reduced motion and color preference media queries
- Audit tooling with pa11y and pa11y-ci
