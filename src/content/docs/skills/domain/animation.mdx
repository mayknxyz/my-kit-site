The animation skill gives Claude deep knowledge of web animation — CSS transitions, keyframes, scroll-driven animations, and reduced motion handling.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when working on animations, transitions, scroll effects, or motion design.

## What It Teaches Claude

- CSS Transitions vs Animations vs Web Animations API
- Common animation patterns (fade, slide, scale, stagger)
- Scroll-driven animations with timeline and range
- Performance rules (only animate composite properties: transform, opacity, filter, clip-path)
- Reduced motion media query implementation
