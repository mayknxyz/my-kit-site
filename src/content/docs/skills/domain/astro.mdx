title: Astro Skill
description: Domain skill for Astro framework projects.
---

The Astro skill gives Claude deep knowledge of the Astro framework — its file-based routing, component islands, content collections, and build system.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when `/mykit.init` detects an Astro project (presence of `astro.config.*`).

## What It Teaches Claude

- Astro component syntax (`.astro` files)
- Content collections and schema validation
- Island architecture and partial hydration
- Integration patterns (Starlight, MDX, etc.)
- Static and SSR build modes
