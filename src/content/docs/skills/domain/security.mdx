The security skill gives Claude deep knowledge of web security — CSP, XSS prevention, CORS, input validation, and security headers.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when configuring security headers, preventing XSS, setting up CORS, or handling secrets.

## What It Teaches Claude

- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- XSS prevention (textContent over innerHTML, sanitization, CSP)
- Input validation server-side with Zod
- CORS configuration with specific origins
- Environment variables and secrets management
