The Git skill gives Claude deep knowledge of Git workflow — conventional commits, branch strategy, and PR conventions.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when committing, branching, creating PRs, or managing Git history.

## What It Teaches Claude

- Conventional commits format (type(scope): description)
- Commit types (feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, test, chore, perf, ci)
- Branch strategy (feature/, fix/, chore/ branches from main)
- PR conventions with title, summary, and test plan
- Small, focused PRs and clean rebase history
