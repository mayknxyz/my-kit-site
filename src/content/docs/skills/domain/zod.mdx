description: Domain skill for Zod schema validation.
---

The Zod skill gives Claude deep knowledge of Zod — schema composition, coercion, discriminated unions, error handling, and type inference.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when writing validation schemas, parsing form data, or defining API contracts.

## What It Teaches Claude

- Schema composition (extend, pick, omit, merge)
- Coercion for form data (z.coerce.number, z.coerce.date, z.coerce.boolean)
- Discriminated unions for tagged union types
- Error handling with safeParse and flatten().fieldErrors
- Type inference with z.infer and common validation patterns
