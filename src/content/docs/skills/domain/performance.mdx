## When It's Active

Activated automatically when optimizing page speed, fonts, images, or diagnosing CLS/LCP/INP issues.

## What It Teaches Claude

- Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms)
- Font loading (self-host WOFF2, font-display: swap, variable fonts)
- Image optimization (responsive srcset, lazy loading, WebP/AVIF)
- Resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch, preload, modulepreload)
- Audit tooling with Lighthouse and Unlighthouse
