title: Biome Skill
description: Domain skill for Biome linter and formatter.
---

The Biome skill gives Claude deep knowledge of Biome — configuration, linting rules, formatting, and CI integration for Astro and Tailwind projects.

## When It's Active

Activated automatically when `/mykit.init` detects Biome (presence of `biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`).

## What It Teaches Claude

- Configuration with biome.json/biome.jsonc
- Formatter settings (indentation, line width, quoting)
- Linter rules with recommended presets
- CSS parser configuration for Tailwind v4
- Astro file overrides and CLI commands
