## Prerequisites

Before installing my-kit, ensure you have:

| Tool | Purpose | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | AI coding assistant | Yes |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | Version control | Yes |
| [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) | Symlink manager | Yes |
| [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) | GitHub operations | For ship commands |
| Bun or Node.js | JS/TS runtime | For JS/TS projects |

## Install

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayknxyz/my-kit.git ~/.my-kit
   ```

2. **Stow the kit into your home directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ~/.my-kit && stow -t ~ .
   ```

   This creates symlinks so Claude Code can discover my-kit's commands and skills globally.

3. **Verify the installation:**

   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.claude/commands/mykit.*.md
   ```

   You should see symlinks for all 29 commands.

</Steps>

## Initialize a Project

Run `init` inside any project to set up my-kit's project-level configuration:

```bash
cd your-project
/mykit.init
```

This creates project-specific settings and ensures Claude Code picks up my-kit's skills for your stack.

## Upgrade

Pull the latest changes and re-stow:

```bash
cd ~/.my-kit && git pull && stow -t ~ .
```

## Uninstall

Remove the symlinks and delete the clone:

```bash
cd ~/.my-kit && stow -D -t ~ . && cd ~ && rm -rf ~/.my-kit
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Uninstalling removes all my-kit commands and skills from Claude Code. Project-level configs (like `.claude/` settings) are not affected.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

- **Stow conflicts** — If `stow` reports conflicts, another file may exist at the symlink target. See [Installation Issues](/troubleshooting/installation-issues/).
- **Commands not found** — Ensure Claude Code is restarted after installing. Run `/mykit.status` to verify.
- **Permission errors** — Make sure `~/.my-kit` is owned by your user, not root.
