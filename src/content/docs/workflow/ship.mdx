### `/mykit.commit`

Stages changes and creates a conventional commit with an auto-generated message.

```bash
/mykit.commit
```

### `/mykit.pr`

Creates a pull request with an auto-generated title and description based on the commits.

```bash
/mykit.pr
```

### `/mykit.release`

Publishes a new release with changelog generation.

```bash
/mykit.release
```
