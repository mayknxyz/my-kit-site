## `/mykit.tasks`

The tasks command converts the implementation plan into a set of discrete, trackable tasks. Each task is small enough to implement in a single focused session.

### Usage

```bash
/mykit.tasks
```

### What It Produces

A task list where each task includes:
- A clear subject line
- Description of what needs to be done
- Dependencies on other tasks
