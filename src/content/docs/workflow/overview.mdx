## The Pipeline

my-kit structures development into a repeatable pipeline:

**Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Ship → Audit**

Each stage has a dedicated command and produces artifacts that feed the next stage. This keeps work focused, traceable, and auditable.

### Stages

1. **Specify** — Define what you're building with `/mykit.specify`
2. **Plan** — Generate an implementation plan with `/mykit.plan`
3. **Tasks** — Break the plan into trackable tasks with `/mykit.tasks`
4. **Implement** — Execute tasks with `/mykit.implement`
5. **Ship** — Commit, PR, and release with `/mykit.commit`, `/mykit.pr`, `/mykit.release`
6. **Audit** — Run quality gates with `/mykit.audit.all`

### Why Spec-Driven?

Starting with a spec ensures Claude understands the full scope before writing code. This prevents scope creep, missed requirements, and aimless implementation.
