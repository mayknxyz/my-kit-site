## `/mykit.specify`

The specify command creates a structured specification for a feature, bug fix, or task. It guides you through defining the problem, requirements, and acceptance criteria.

### What It Produces

A spec file that captures:
- **Context** — What problem are we solving?
- **Requirements** — What must the solution do?
- **Acceptance criteria** — How do we know it's done?
- **Constraints** — What are the boundaries?

### Usage

```bash
/mykit.specify
```

Claude will walk you through creating the spec interactively.
