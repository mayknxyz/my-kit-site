## `/mykit.audit.all`

The audit command runs all 5 audit agents against your changes:

| Agent | What It Checks |
|-------|---------------|
| Security | Vulnerabilities, secrets, injection risks |
| Accessibility | WCAG compliance, ARIA usage, semantic HTML |
| Performance | Bundle size, rendering, lazy loading |
| Code Quality | Patterns, complexity, test coverage |
| Spec Compliance | Does the implementation match the spec? |

### Usage

```bash
/mykit.audit.all
```

### Individual Audits

You can also run audits individually:

```bash
/mykit.audit.security
/mykit.audit.accessibility
/mykit.audit.performance

```
