## Stow Reports Conflicts

If `stow -t ~ .` reports conflicts, another file already exists at the symlink target.

**Fix:** Check what's at the conflicting path and either remove it or back it up:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/mykit.init.md
```

If it's a real file (not a symlink), move it aside before stowing.

## Commands Not Found After Install

Claude Code may need to be restarted to discover new commands.

**Fix:**
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Run `/mykit.status` to verify commands are detected

## Permission Errors

If you get permission errors during install, the `~/.my-kit` directory may be owned by root.

**Fix:**

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.my-kit
```

## GNU Stow Not Installed

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install stow
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install stow
```

**Linux (Arch):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
```
