## Spec Not Found

If `/mykit.plan` says it can't find a spec, ensure you've run `/mykit.specify` first in the current project.

**Fix:** Run `/mykit.specify` to create a spec, then try again.

## Plan Won't Generate

If `/mykit.plan` fails to produce a plan, the spec may be too vague or missing required sections.

**Fix:** Re-run `/mykit.specify` and ensure all sections (context, requirements, acceptance criteria) are filled in.

## Tasks Not Tracking

If tasks aren't being tracked or updated, the task list may not have been initialized.

**Fix:** Run `/mykit.tasks` to regenerate the task list from the current plan.

## Audit Agent Failures

If an audit agent crashes or produces no output, it may be hitting context limits on very large changesets.

**Fix:**
1. Try running individual audits instead of `/mykit.audit.all`
2. Reduce the scope of changes being audited
3. Ensure you're on the latest version of my-kit (`cd ~/.my-kit && git pull`)

## GitHub CLI Not Authenticated

Ship commands (`/mykit.commit`, `/mykit.pr`, `/mykit.release`) require `gh` to be authenticated.

**Fix:**

```bash
gh auth status    # Check current auth
gh auth login     # Authenticate if needed
```
