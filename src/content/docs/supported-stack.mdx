## Stack Compatibility

my-kit works with any project that uses Claude Code, but provides **domain skills** — deep framework knowledge — for the following:

| Category | Technology | Skill |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | Astro | `astro` |
| Frontend | Svelte / SvelteKit | `svelte` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | `tailwind` |
| Language | TypeScript | `typescript` |
| Hosting | Cloudflare (Pages, Workers, D1) | `cloudflare` |
| Testing | Vitest, Playwright | `testing` |

## How Domain Skills Work

When you run `/mykit.init`, my-kit detects your project's stack and activates the relevant domain skills. These skills give Claude deep knowledge of framework conventions, best practices, and common patterns.

Domain skills are loaded as CLAUDE.md instructions — they don't install dependencies or modify your code. They simply teach Claude how to work effectively with your stack.

## Adding More Skills

my-kit's skill system is extensible. See the [Extension Guide](/architecture/extension-guide/) for how to create custom domain skills for your stack.
